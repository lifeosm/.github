In today's world, the sheer volume of information and the pace of
our lives are increasingly becoming sources of stress. We are so
[afraid of missing out](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear_of_missing_out)
on something important that we keep loading ourselves with this
ever-growing data stream.[^1]

Our personal and professional lives are in dissonance, exacerbated with each
new phase of digital transformation. Remote work, endless meetings,
frequent changes, and a mountain of information to absorb the reason
for [occupational burnout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_burnout).[^2]

But what if we could process more data **without risking** emotional burnout?
Can we **scale our capabilities** without exerting ourselves excessively?
Remember everything that interests us, anytime, in **unlimited quantities**.
Remember important events and tasks. Become mindful and serene.

At [OctoLab][], we believe it's possible, and our mission is to make these
possibilities a reality! How?

Life will be better with [âœ¨sparkle][Sparkle] in mind and [ðŸ¤¹tact][Tact] in action!

[^1]: Fear of missing out (FOMO) is apprehension that one is either not
      knowing about or missing out on information, events, experiences,
      or life decisions that could make one's life better.

[^2]: Occupational burnout is a psychological syndrome emerging as a prolonged
      response to chronic interpersonal stressors on the job.
